This file is a short list of items you need to buy to advance to the next level. 
Most of them are quite optional (extra armour to win a fight faster, etc.), but some of them are necessary and expensive.
Keep that in mind when you are using a free account, where money is scare. 


Requirements
1. World 2 (optional) - just how much you think is right
  Near the end of this world (035 Rich Forager) you may want to buy your first own armour and sword. 
  It makes the level easier and is more comfortable for the next levels.
2. World 3 (necessary) - 2100
  In the first third of this world (010 Operation 'Killdeer') you will need to buy an item which allows you to get information about your own health.
  The ingame equivalent of a fitness tracker costs you 2100, which is not really cheap. 
  Keep that in mind before you spent all your hard earned money on other items!
3. World 3 (necessary) - 360
  In the first world at level 014 Keeping Time you will need to buy a bracelet which gives you the possibility to wait.
  It is not nearly as expensive as the first item you have to buy, so you should be fine!
4. World 3 (necessary) - 81
  After almost half through world 3, you will need to buy a hammer which lets you build decoys. 
  It is tremendously cheap, so it should be no problem.
5. World 3 (Optional) - 100
  You will need some new glasses for the level Cubic Minefield. This level is optional so you can come back later if necessary.
