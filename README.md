# codecombat
This is a database of codes for the online coding "game" CodeCombat.
The solutions are in python. Feel free to read if you get stuck or want to look up something.
Just remember, looking up solutions isn't nearly as much fun as coming up with a own solution.
Most solutions should be fitting for any character, level and equipment. 
However if you get stuck, use the normal warrior type with equipment fitting for this level.
If some special equipment is needed (f.e. to build barricades) the description of the level will tell you.
