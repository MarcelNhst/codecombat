# This code uses like the last one a sword which can cleave
# If it is too hard buy some armor and maybe another sword. 
# If the sword uses a different kind of power (f.e. "power-up") modify the code as you see fit.

# Use "if" and "else if" to handle any situation.
# Put it all together to defeat enemies and pick up coins!
# Make sure you bought great armor from the item shop! 400 health recommended.
