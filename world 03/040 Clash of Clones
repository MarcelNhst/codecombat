# This level is really hard, I tried a lot of things. Just targeting your clone does not seem to work.
# Also trying to hide behing the archers is not a good idea, they will go down to easily. 
# I also tried different kinds of equipment due to your clone wearing the same. 
# I bought the most expensive shield and equipped the worst sword I had with the idea of just hitting the clone with the shield.
# He do not use special strategies like that, but even then I would lose.
# So I tried playing defensive and just bash when I can. That worked, but it was very close as well.
# The result: With just 6 lines of code you can win this!

# You'll need good strategy to win this one!
# Your clone will have the same equipment you have!
# But, they're not very skilled at using special powers.

#Finds the enemy with the most health and returns it
