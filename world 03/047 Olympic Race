# This time I did not suceed by telling my pet to stay at the start before the wizard says Start.
# You can see my attempt still in the code if you want to try for yourself, the pet is just to fast with crossing the start line.
# So I remembered there is also the spawn event. I tried to implement an event handler for that and it worked! 

# The pet must win the race.
# Runners should touch their teams mark and run back.

    if event.speaker == referee and event.message == "Start":
        # Make the pet run to the red mark.
        pet.moveXY(54, 27)
        # Then run back.
