# Such challanges are really good. You can reuse that function in a lot of other levels where you need the total health of a group!

# Attack when your soldiers' total health is greater
# than the ogres' total health

# Write a function that takes an array of units as input
# And returns the sum of all the units' health

        index += 1
    return totalHealth

    # Get the total health of your soldiers and the ogres.
    # Say "Attack" when your side has more total health.
